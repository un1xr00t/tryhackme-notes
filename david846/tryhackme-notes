# TryHackMe Notes

Welcome to my personal repository of TryHackMe notes. This collection is designed to support a wide range of cybersecurity learning paths‚Äîfrom beginners just starting out to more advanced topics in ethical hacking, red teaming, and defensive operations. Each folder represents a room or challenge and includes key steps, tools used, and insights gained.
