# TryHackMe Notes

Welcome to my personal repository of TryHackMe notes. This collection is meant to help me track my learning progress, reinforce knowledge, and serve as a quick reference for challenges and rooms I've completed.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Commands

I use tools like `nmap`, `enum4linux`, `hydra`, and `metasploit`. You'll find snippets and common commands in each room's note file.

## 📌 Goals

- [x] Create a central place for all TryHackMe notes  
- [x] Include detailed scan results like `.nmap` outputs  
- [x] Organize rooms into individual folders  
- [x] Add markdown templates for consistency  
- [x] Make a dark, hacker-themed banner for the repo  
- [x] Enhance the main `README.md` to look clean and professional  


Let me know if you want to add any stretch goals or automate anything next!
