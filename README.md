# tryhackme-notes

Welcome to my personal repository of TryHackMe notes. This collection is meant to help me track my learning progress, reinforce knowledge, and serve as a quick reference for challenges and rooms I've completed.

## 🧰 Tools & Commands

I use tools like `nmap`, `enum4linux`, `hydra`, and `metasploit`. You'll find snippets and common commands in each room's note file.

## 📌 Goals

- [x] Maintain clean notes per room
- [x] Include scan results like `.nmap` files
- [ ] Automate template creation with a script
